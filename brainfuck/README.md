#Brainfuck

(Yes, I actually do some Brainfuck.)

Eventhing here is made from the [Brainfuck java project](https://github.com/hemangandhi/derpspace/tree/master/Java/brainfuck).

Each file is explained and of course, this is all extremely experimental.

[Here's what brainfuck is.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) Hopefully, that wasn't inspirational.
