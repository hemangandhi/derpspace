#Java

Project, by project:
* brainfuck: A simple brainfuck interpreter. All the brainfuck here is from this.
* BrainfuckApp: An attempt at an Android app (didn't complete).
* canvas: A horrible rendition of paint.
* chain reaction automaton: A runner of the [Chain Reaction Game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BuddyMattEnt.ChainReaction)
* chess: A crappy chess implementation.
* khet: An implementation of [khet](http://www.khet.com/)
* MazeGenerator: An attempt at making a maze maker. Failed. Full implementation in Clojure.
* minesweeper: An implementation of minesweeper.
* othello: An implementation of Othello.
* regexTester: A way to test regex on strings you input. Uses Java's `re`.
* yahtzee: An implementation of yahtzee. N-player.
* PersistentDataStructures: A few persistent data structures (stack only, so far). Will re-write in c++ once I figure out memory management.
* misc: Just a few classes. Has a minor assignment and an idea for a project (zuma, it's explained in the notes for that project.)
* mankala: an implementation of [the mankala game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala). UI needs improvement.
