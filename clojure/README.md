#Clojure

Some projects will have their own README files.

About the projects that don't:
* 8_queens is an 8 queens problem solver.
* data-algebra is based on a book I read on data algebra and won't make sense without [this (see the part about the book)](http://www.algebraixdata.com/)
* JSON is a json parser. Hellalujah for `read-string`!
