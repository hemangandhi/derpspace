#Clojure

Some projects will have their own README files.

About the projects that don't:
* 8_queens is an 8 queens problem solver.
* data-algebra is based on a book I read on data algebra and won't make sense without [this (see the part about the book)](http://www.algebraixdata.com/)
* JSON is a json parser. Hellalujah for `read-string`!
* chain_rxn is the same as the Java "chain reaction automaton" project except with an automaton and less crash-related issues.
* 2048 runs [2048](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) and allows for a few simple bots.
* wrappers has a macro for support of python-like decorators. Contains the partial-function decorator from pythons/ein klien algorithm
