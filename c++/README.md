A few c++ things.

LinearDataStructures has a simple singly linked list, Queues and Stacks so far...

Some functions has a few random things I've just wanted to try, including an implementation
of python's range object (as a C++ `std::iterator` with indexing and magic!).

TreeDataStructures has a partial BST.

Note that I was a child when I started, so LinearDataStructures and TreeDataStructures have the entirity of some VS code project.
This ain't it -- I use less obtrusive tooling now, so will have some duplication of "this is a tree data structure" but won't plonk
in the vscode project tree.
