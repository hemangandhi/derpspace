A few c++ things.

LinearDataStructures has a simple singly linked list, Queues and Stacks so far...

Some functions has a few random things I've just wanted to try, including an implementation
of python's range object (as a C++ `std::iterator` with indexing and magic!).

TreeDataStructures has a partial BST.
