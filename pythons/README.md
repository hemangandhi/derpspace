#Pythons

A bunch of un-organized python things.

A few files of note:
* factor_things has a function to factor integers etc.
* hue_light is designed to manipulate a Phillips Hue light. (Yes, IoT here!)
* op_sudoku_solver is an incomplete Kenken solver. There's a complete version in Clojure.
* string_permute yields all the unique permutations of a given string.
* template decorator is an experiment in python decorators. It forces type checking for simple functions.

In the folder 'divesh' are a few more files (made for a friend):
* A solver for the 8 queens problem.
* A simulation of Conway's game of life.
* A Langton's Ant runner.
* A prime number generator.
* A sudoku solution checker.

The folder called algebra has:
* A matrix utility (incomplete rref).
* A polynomial class.
* A ton of cool operator overloading!

The stat final project folder has a chi-squared test runner that parses a special format (outlined in the file).

Word search web has a word search maker.

Also, please forgive my love for one-liners.
